                <h1>Data Statements</h1>
                <p>The Data Statements provide an overview about what, who and in which context the data been annotated. You can find an overview here about the used labels, topics and annotators. However we do not present unrelated tweets in the overview main page.</p>

                <h2>A. CURATION RATIONALE</h2>
                <p>The dataset includes 3.500 English tweets annotated for stance detection on four stance ("favour", "against", "comment" and "unrelated"). Each tweet is assigned to one of the following topic groups: "Democracy", "Research", family reunification, "ALS",  "Nordstream2", "Climate",  "EU membership/UK", "Healthcare", "Covid19",  "Digitalization", "Rule of Law", "Gender equality",  "Migration and Asylum", "Agriculture", "Spain and Catalan", "Longevity", "Europeday". The topics are extracted and verified topics related to the european union in the time from September 2020 to August 2021.</p>

                <h2>B. LANGUAGE VARIETY</h2>
                <p>The data was collected in late 2021 via the Twitter search API and python library snscrape. The language is non native English of Europeans.</p>

                <h2>C. SPEAKER DEMOGRAPHIC</h2>
                <p>Speakers, in this context Twitter users, can not clearly been defined. Since the geographic of interest is in the EU and most EU citizens do not speak English as native language, the quality of English, as well as the linguistics can not clearly been defined. The speakers are not a restricted user group of Twitter, therefore the age, gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status differs. But each tweet is clearly assigned to one speaker. One Speaker can have several tweets in the dataset.</p>

                <h2>D. ANNOTATOR DEMOGRAPHIC </h2>
                <p>Annotators are highly educated master students or engineers, in age of 25 to 50. Both gender and ethnic is varying, gender is split by 50-50. Ethnic is all from European Union. Every Annotator is aware of current topics in the EU as well as of the data source Twitter. The Annotators got a detailed instruction on how to annotate the data and were trained in either data science or EU or Social science. None of the Annotators is native language in English, but study their related fields in English and feel comfortable in both writing and speaking.</p>

                <h2>E. SPEECH SITUATION</h2>
                <p>The dataset includes Twitter data from September 2020 to August 2021 and is therefore in the first year of "Covid19" Pandemic, collecting especially data related to the European Union. Its short text tweets of maximal characters of 280 (defined by Twitter). The dataset is asynchronous, so no relation between the entries exist, however each tweet is assigned to exact one topic.</p>

                <h2>F. TEXT CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
                <p>Since the text source is Twitter, slang, shortcuts and hashtags are present in the dataset.</p>

                <h2>G. RECORDING QUALITY </h2>
                <p>N/A</p>
                
                <h2>H. OTHER</h2>
                <p>The dataset is fully based on topics that occur in the EU Twitter community, generated from two hashtags. Those were introduced by the European Union President and are therefore reliable information source. The topics were checked by using a European wide Press website from official German company.</p>
