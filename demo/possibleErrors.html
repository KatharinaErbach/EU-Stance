                <h1>Possible Errors</h1>
                <p>The intention of the tweet was identified as the main source of the top-3 types of errors. These include: (a) indirect, where the EU is not directly mentioned in the tweet but rather indirect. (b) Annotation error, where the Human annotator underlay an error, (c) suggestions, which were not seen as such but rather as a critique, (d) demanding tweet, which is more seen as a suggestion and therefore labeled as "favour", rather than "against". Secondly, we identified tweets where specific, known in NLP problems occur: (e) sarcasm, (f) misspelling and (g) polarizing tweets. The latter means that a tweet consists of a variety of polarizing sentences mixed together. Finally, we identified dataset specific problems: (h) topic and (i) EU impact. In those error types, several topics were available in the tweet text, where the model suggests a label for one of them, while the tweet is assigned to another topic. Or the connection to the EU is indirectly given or missing.</p>


                <h2>a) Indirect </h2>
                <p>Caused by no direct mention of EU in tweet text. <br>Example Error from Favour to Unrelated: #moderna just got approval from EMA  #Covid19 #vaccine #NewYear #USA</p>

                <h2>b) Annotation </h2>
                <p>Human annotation error.<br>
                    Example Error from Favour to Unrelated: As a guest I feel very safe here in Taiwan. Here life goes on normally. In Europe and the USA the 2nd wave is coming in. <br>
                    Example from Comment to Against: The @EU_Commission did it again: Politically motivated #ruleoflaw report, a compilation of our critics favorite accusations, takes issue with our new child protection law. EC continues to care more about the LGBTQ lobby than the rights of national minorities or anti-Semitism.</p>


                    <h2>c) Suggestion </h2>
                    <p>A suggestion which is not seen as such.<br>

                    </p>

                    <h2> d) Demanding</h2>
                    <p> A demanding manner which is not seen as such.<br>
                        Example from Against to Comment: He declares himself ‚ÄùCovid-Franco‚Äù for six months and the persecution of Catalans continues with the support of king @CasaReal. EU and UN must act!</p>

                    <h2> e) Sarcasm</h2>
                    <p> Sarcasm.<br>
                        Example from Against to Unrelated: Have been there cases where Ministers have un-made a forged coreper agreement, or is that unprecedented? asking for an enemy here...</p>

                    <h2>f) Misspelling </h2>

                    <h2> g) Polarizing</h2>
                    <p> Variety of polarizing sentences in one tweet.<br>
                        Example from Against to Favour: @LesNews24 Human rights and EU values violationsÔ∏è. Good news is that Polish women are strong and they will not stop.<br>

                        Example from Unrelated to Comment: Negotiations with #manchester failed over ¬£5m. Negotiations with the #eu failing on fishing - 0.1% of the UK economy.
