The index.html holds the json files (schema can be found at json_schema_filtering and json_schema_data). Those can be replaced, whilst using the same structure.
If changes are made, make sure to keep the same topic names for all folders. The tweets were accessed by their unique tweet ID.

The image folder holds the statistic images of the type hashtag, mention, emoji and stance. The statistics were currently generated via the python library matplotlib and saved under the topic name. We present one statistic of each type for each topic.
The image size is 432 × 288 can however be changed to other size if needed.

The tweet similarity is currently calculated by the cosine similarity between the tweets. Similar tweets and their score were stored at the original tweets json section. 

The tweet json file does not need to have an entry in either of the fields, but must stick to the given structure.
